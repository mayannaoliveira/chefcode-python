## Arithmetic Operations
 
We can also perform mathematical operations using **`print`**.

```python
print(2+4) # Output: 6
```

The above code will output the result of the mathematical operation, which is **6**.
**Note**: If you enclose the operation within **quotes**, the entire expression will be treated as text (a string) and will be printed exactly as it is.

```python
print("2+4") # Output: 2+4
```

In this case, the output will be the string **"2 + 4"** instead of the result of the addition.
- Without quotes: The expression is evaluated, and the result is printed.
- With quotes: The expression is treated as a string and printed as it is.
Understanding this distinction is important for correctly displaying the results of calculations versus showing text.

**Task**

In the editor we have written half code for you. Some portion of the code contains __ (underscores). Remove those underscores and write 21 in place of first underscore and 40 in place of the next underscore.
To pass this exercise, your code has to print the sum of 21 and 40.

**Solve**

```python
# Replace the code print(__ + __) with print(21 + 40)

print(21+40)
```

**Output**

`61`
