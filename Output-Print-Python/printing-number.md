## Printing a number
We'll begin with the print statement, which is commonly the first thing you learn in most programming languages.
The print statement in Python is used to display output on the screen. You can use it to print numbers, text, or the results of expressions.
Let us output a number in Python.
Some code has been populated in the IDE on the right.  
This code just prints 12 on the screen when you run it.
Click on **Submit** below the IDE to know the result. Then click on next to continue.

Solve:
```python
print(12)
```

Output:
`12`
